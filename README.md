This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Built for the freeCodeCamp front-end libraries certificate - this project plays sounds when you click on or press the corresponding key of the keyboard styled "drum-machine". The design (and a few of the sound effects) were based on Gene Belcher's keyboard from the animated television show "Bob's Burgers".
